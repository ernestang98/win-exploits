# JavaScript Overview

How does javascript work?

```
code -> token -> ast -> bytecode -> optimized code
``` 

- V8 handles parsing code into AST

- Ignition handles interpreting AST into Bytecode

- Sparkplug compiles Bytecode into non-optimized native code

- Turbofan optimised non-optimized native code

# V8 Object Internals

Javascript types are dynamic, but how does this shit work if javascript is based on c++ which is statically typed? - Map a.k.a. Hidden Class (Shape)

Most objects are structured as so:

```
--------------
|     Map    |
--------------
| Properties |
--------------
|  Elements  |
--------------
```

Properties points to the values in the key-value pairs of object while Elements points to the values in an array/in an object (numbered properties) (both technically can function as backing stores). There are 2 kinds of properties:

1. Fast Properties

2. Slow/Dictionary Properties

# Pointer Tagging

- In v8, values represented as objects and allocated on the heap

- If we need to keep allocating on heap everytime we manipulate/create/delete object, that sucks

- Instead, store some of the values inline so that we dont have to keep using the heap

- Then how to differentiate object pointer from inline value? Pointer Tagging

# Pointer Compression

- Use 4 bytes instead of 8 bytes 

- MSB stored in r13

- Serve as some form of sandbox 

# Chrome Architecture

- V8: JavaScript Engine

- Blink: Renderer Engine

- Mojo: IPC between Browser and Renderer

- Renderer Sandbox: 1 tab = 1 renderer = 1 process (low privileges)

- Isolate: a running instance of a V8 engine (like a thread to a process?). 1 thread is allocated 1 isolate object

- Context: global scope for variables, allows differentiating of variables belonging to 1 window from another

# Blink

- Renderer Engine, forked from WebKit

- [Uses various allocators](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0e94f26e8/third_party/WebKit/Source/wtf/Allocator.md)
