### Notes

- JavaScript engine nomanclature can been quite confusing (especially regarding those released by microsoft). The JavaScript engine used by IE and earlier versions of Edge are both known as Chakra. For IE's Chakra, the DLL which implements this engine before IE9 is jscript.dll, while the DLL that handles IE9 to IE11 is jscript9.dll. All this information can be found at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript)
